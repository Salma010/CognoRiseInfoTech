ðŸ“Š BigMart Sales Analysis - Key Findings

In this recent project, I explored sales patterns and item visibility at BigMart, yielding interesting insights into customer preferences and outlet characteristics. Here are the highlights:

Total Sales and Popular Item Types:

BigMart achieved an impressive total sales of 801K across all items, with 16 distinct item types contributing to this revenue.
Snack Foods and Fruits & Vegetables lead in visibility with 54 items each, and they also top the sales charts at 116K and 112K respectively, highlighting their strong demand among customers.
Average Price of Fat Content:

Regular fat items contribute a larger share (65%) of the revenue compared to low-fat items (35%). This might indicate that customers are inclined to purchase regular fat items, potentially guiding product stocking decisions.
Sales by Outlet Type and Size:

Among outlet types, Supermarket Type1 outlets consistently perform well, with steady sales of around 90K in recent years. This stability underscores the reliability of Type1 outlets in driving revenue.
Insights into outlet size and type could help optimize inventory and tailor marketing strategies for each outlet type to maximize sales.
Sales by Item Type:

Aside from snack foods and fresh produce, other key categories include Household items (94K) and Frozen Foods (76K), followed by Dairy and Canned Goods. Understanding these preferences allows BigMart to align stock with customer demand and enhance the shopping experience.
These findings provide valuable insights into customer preferences, purchasing behavior, and outlet performance, paving the way for strategic decisions in inventory management and product marketing.
